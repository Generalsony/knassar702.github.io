# Recon3r

Recon3r is a script that does simple reconnassaince for people with low internet as an alternative
for LazyRecon, it gets subdomains, screenshots, juicy data, sources.

**Subdomains** using tomnomnom's tools:
```bash
echo "Subdomain generating..."
cd $output
mkdir $domain
cd $domain
assetfinder --subs-only $domain > domains
cat domains | httprobe | tee hosts
meg .
```

**Getting Juicy Data** using tomnomnom's tools:
```bash
find . | html-tool attribs src > Founds/sources
gf base64 > Founds/base64
gf debug-pages > Founds/debug-pages
gf fw > Founds/fw
gf php-curl > Founds/php-curl
gf php-errors > Founds/php-errors
gf php-sinks > Founds/php-sinks
gf php-sources > Founds/php-sources
gf sec > Founds/sec
gf takeovers > Founds/takeovers
gf urls > Founds/urls
gf aws-keys > Founds/aws-keys
gf meg-headers > Founds/meg-headers
gf servers > Founds/servers
gf firebase > Founds/firebase
gf php-serialized > Founds/php-serialized
gf strings > Founds/strings
gf upload-fields > Founds/upload-fields
gf cors > Founds/cors
gf json-sec > Founds/json-sec
gf ip > Founds/ip
gf http-auth > Founds/http-auth
gf s3-buckets > Founds/s3-buckets
gf go-functions > Founds/go-functions
```

**Screenshooting Subs** using cutycapt:
```bash
echo "Screenshotting Subdomains..."
mkdir Images
while IFS= read -r line
do
	cutycapt --out=Images/$line.png --url=$line --max-wait=15000
done < "domains"
```

Recon3r is improved and uses my own tools " similar to tom's "
but the latest version is private and that code is simple explaination
of the script and the publicly accessible one
